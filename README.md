# AcademicInfo
## System for Managing Academic Information
The process of managing information required in an academic environment is a time-consuming actvity.
In order to produce and manage this information, using a dedicated software application is from far the best solution.
Mainly it is about classroom activities engaging students and teachers.
This System will keep track of information for each student starting with the first undergraduate year and finishing with the last one or with the last master year.
Each faculty may have different specializations both for the undergraduate and master degrees; a student is enrolled in one of these.
Each faculty year will have a contract of studies, a curriculum (list of mandatory disciplines + 1 optional discipline).
